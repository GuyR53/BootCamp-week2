# BootCamp-week2
# Write a password validator script as described below and store it in the main branch of your git repository

## Write a bash script to validate password strength with the following requirements:

### Length – minimum of 10 characters.
### Contain both alphabet and number.
### Include both the small and capital case letters.
### Color the output green if it passed the validation and red if it didn’t.
### Return exit code 0 if it passed the validation and exit code 1 if it didn’t.
### If a validation failed provide a message explaining why.
### Make sure your script can run automatically without the need for human intervention.
### Write the script in the best possible way (for performance and UX).

## Create a feature branch to improve the script as described below:

## Extend the script by adding the following capability:

### If the option “-f” is added the password should be retrieved from a file.

### Create a pull request to integrate your feature branch into the main branch.

## Create an additional branch an name it “powershell”

### In the “powershell” branch write the same script this time using powershell

## Migrate your repository (including history) to another provider (Bitbucket)
## Create a new branch called “bonus” to implement the below

### Create the first powershell script that open “notepad” with the content “Hello Bootcamp!”
### Create the second script with the following logic:
### Create a “windows task” that must execute the script (open "notpad") periodically according to the time (passed as a parameter)
### Wait X seconds (received as parameter)
### Disable the task in the windows task scheduler (to avoid it’s execution)
### Get all task’s full names and create a clean output with the task names

## Result on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/guyr53/bootcamp-week2_github_migration/src/bonus/
