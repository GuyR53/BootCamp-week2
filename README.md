## Write a password validator script as described below:

## Write a bash script to validate password strength with the following requirements:

 1. Length – minimum of 10 characters.
 2. Contain both alphabet and number.
 3. Include both the small and capital case letters.
 4. Color the output green if it passed the validation and red if it didn’t.
 5. Return exit code 0 if it passed the validation and exit code 1 if it didn’t.
 6. If a validation failed provide a message explaining why.
 7. Make sure your script can run automatically without the need for human intervention.
 8. Write the script in the best possible way (for performance and UX).

## Create a feature branch to improve the script, Extend the script by adding the following capability:

## Create an additional branch and name it “powershell”

 In the “powershell” branch write the same script this time using powershell

## Migrate your repository (including history) to another provider (Bitbucket), Create a new branch called “bonus” to implement the below


1. Create the first powershell script that open “notepad” with the content “Hello Bootcamp!”
  ### Create the second script with the following logic:
2. Create a “windows task” that must execute the script (open "notpad") periodically according to the time (passed as a parameter)
3. Wait X seconds (received as parameter)
4. Disable the task in the windows task scheduler (to avoid it’s execution)
5. Get all task’s full names and create a clean output with the task names
